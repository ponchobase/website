// 06. Components

// The Components layer is where we begin to style recognisable pieces of UI. We're still binding onto classes here,
// so our specificity hasn't yet increased. However, this layer is more explicit than the last one in that we are now
// styling explicit, designed pieces of the DOM.

// We shouldn't find any selectors with a lower specificity than one class in this layer. This is where the majority of your
// work will happen after initial project set-up. Adding new components and features usually makes up the vast majority of
// development.
